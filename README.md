# Telco-Churn-Analysis
- The factors to be improved upon to reduce churn rate as it is one of the biggest problem in Telecom Industries.
- Exploratory Data Analysis, replacing missing values by median. Classification models explored Logistic Regression,
SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, ADA-Boost, XG-Boost, Light GBM.
- Best performance is measured 81% accuracy, 0.85 AUC for hyperparameter tuned (Randomized Search CV) Light
GBM. Conclusions based on SHAP plot and Feature Importance.
